<h4 align="center" class="style9" style="font-family:Helvetica"><span class="style19">Bubble Harp</span></h4>
<h4 align="center" class="style9" style="font-family:Helvetica"><span class="style17"> by Scott Sona Snibbe<br>

<p class="style9" style="font-family:Helvetica"><em>Bubble Harp </em> draws shapes around each point  a person makes as she touches the screen. Each of these shapes is a polygon that encloses all of the space  closer to that point than any other. These shapes, collectively called a Voronoi Diagram describe many natural processes, including the structure of bubbles,    cells, honeycomb, fish scales, the drying of desert sand, animal  dominance (including the patterns that dogs pee in), and the gravitational influence of stars. In the world of marketing, these diagrams are used in analyzing the distance of consumers to the nearest fast food restaurant.
<p class="style9" style="font-family:Helvetica"><em>Bubble Harp</em>  uses Voronoi diagrams as a way of relating to gesture. As long as one touches the screen, <em>Bubble Harp</em> records the exact temporal and spatial movement of the person's fingers. Letting go, the points repeat this motion endlessly. As successive points are added, a Voronoi diagram is dynamically built around these points. Since each point's playback duration differs, the repeat period of the system is very large. This is analogous to Brian Eno's tape loop experiments that use multiple cycling audio tapes with  varying durations to create complex and unanticipated musical interrelationships. The visual composition process of this system is neither strictly additive (like music) nor subtractive (like painting), since, as points are added, they successively add lines, but, depending on their placement,  may subtract space, creating openness instead of more complexity.
<p class="style9" style="font-family:Helvetica"><em>Bubble Harp </em> is a work of interactive software art originally created in 1997. This version is an iPhone/iPad application based on the original code.
This version also incorporates  audio experiments from the same time period  to create a musical composition based on the order, length, and duration of the lines drawn. The songs created with <em>Bubble Harp</em> are, like Jazz, always varying within the structure created by the author, rather than simply looping over-and-over.
<p class="style9" style="font-family:Helvetica"><span class="style11" style="font-family:Helvetica">Version 2.1 for iPhone/iPad/iPod uses openFrameworks, Jonathan Shewchuk's Triangle library, and the FMOD Sound System by Firelight Technologies</span>

<h4 class="style9" style="font-family:Helvetica"><a name="about"></a>About the Dynamic Systems Series</h4>
<p class="style9" style="font-family:Helvetica"><em>Bubble Harp</em> is part of the <em>Dynamic Systems Series</em>, a series of screen-based artworks driven by human touch. The only way  one's body  enters  a desktop computer is through the mouse, and the cursor is the projection of the body into the screen. Take a close look at a desktop computer's screen and you'll notice that the most lively element is the cursor: the only object that moves with personality. These works take the cursor&mdash;the projection of the body into the computer&mdash;and create a system in response. With the introduction of the iPhone and similar  devices, your body now directly connects with these systems through physical touch.
<p class="style9"  style="font-family:Helvetica">Each work in the <em>Dynamic Systems Series</em> is  what scientists call a <em>dynamic system</em>: a model of natural, mathematical or algorithmic reality. These systems let you touch an immaterial world that has  consistent and predictable reactions, and the infinite variety of nature. Although there are few surprises when you visit a beach or pond,  the experience is  subtly different each time. Similarly, with these artworks the intention is for a person  to feel an instant and intuitive sense of presence and control, while spending more time with a system provides greater reward. Like a musical instrument, the effect of the program on the mind is equal to the effect of the mind on the program.</p>
<p class="style9"  style="font-family:Helvetica">These pieces blur the line between artwork and art-making tool. The artwork is the set of rules, which construct a system in which the viewer is an essential part. A traditional media example of this concept is Sol LeWitt's  work&mdash;sets of algorithmic drawing instructions for gallery staff to execute, rather than  a computer. However, within the dynamic medium of computation, the  expression of the rules continuously changes in response to the active collaboration of the viewer.</p>
