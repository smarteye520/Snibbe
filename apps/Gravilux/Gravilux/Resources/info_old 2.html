<h4 align="center" style="font-family:Helvetica"><em>Gravilux</em></h4>
<p align="center" style="font-family:Helvetica">by Scott Sona Snibbe</p>
<p align="center" style="font-family:Helvetica">&#169; 1998-2010</p>
<p align="center" style="font-family:Helvetica"><a href="http://www.snibbe.com">www.snibbe.com</a></p>
<p align="center" style="font-family:Helvetica">Version 1.0.1 for iPhone and iPad using openFrameworks</p>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica">With each touch in <em>Gravilux, </em>you exert a gravitational pull on a world of simulated stars.  Though inspired by Newton's  equations, <em>Gravilux</em> doesn't follow our universe's laws.  The stars wrap from one side of a flat world to the other and their apparent three-dimensional movements are a perceptual illusion. Stars are also free from  mutual attraction, preventing the forming of galaxies and solar systems; and here antigravity  is   possible.
<p style="font-family:Helvetica"><em>Gravilux</em> begins with a stage trick as a Cartesian grid  transforms into a natural system that behaves in turn  like galaxies,    subatomic particles, or dust on  a  pond. This transformation is a metaphor for the <em>Dynamic Systems Series</em> itself, which tries to convey an instrumental, naturalistic, and infinitely expressive experience within the confines of computation. <em>Gravilux's</em> name is an homage to the <em>Clavilux</em>&mdash;an early light performance instrument, also known as a <em>color organ</em>, created by the early twentieth century artist Thomas Wilfred.
<p style="font-family:Helvetica"><em>Gravilux</em> is a work of interactive   software art originally created in 1998. This version is   an iPhone/iPad application based on the original code.
<h4 style="font-family:Helvetica"><a name="about"></a>About the Dynamic Systems Series</h4>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica"><em>Gravilux</em> is part of the <em>Dynamic Systems Series</em>, a series of screen-based artworks driven by human touch. The only way  one's body  enters  a desktop computer is through the mouse, and the cursor is the projection of the body into the screen. Take a close look at a desktop computer's screen and you'll notice that the most lively element is the cursor: the only object that moves with personality. These works take the cursor&mdash;the projection of the body into the computer&mdash;and create a system in response. With the introduction of the iPhone and similar  devices, your body now directly connects with these systems through physical touch.
<p  style="font-family:Helvetica">Each work in the <em>Dynamic Systems Series</em> is  what scientists call a <em>dynamic system</em>: a model of natural, mathematical or algorithmic reality. These systems let you touch an immaterial world that has  consistent and predictable reactions, and the infinite variety of nature. Although there are few surprises when you visit a beach or pond,  the experience is  subtly different each time. Similarly, with these artworks the intention is for a person  to feel an instant and intuitive sense of presence and control, while spending more time with a system provides greater reward. Like a musical instrument, the effect of the program on the mind is equal to the effect of the mind on the program.</p>
<p  style="font-family:Helvetica">These pieces blur the line between artwork and art-making tool. The artwork is the set of rules which construct a system in which the viewer is an essential part. A traditional media example of this concept is Sol LeWitt's  work&mdash;sets of algorithmic drawing instructions for gallery staff to execute, rather than  a computer. However, within the dynamic medium of computation, the  expression of the rules continuously changes in response to the active collaboration of the viewer.</p>
<p  style="font-family:Helvetica">The other works in the Dynamic Systems Series include <em><a href="http://snibbe.com/store/bubbleharp">Bubble Harp</a></em> and <em><a href="http://snibbe.com/store/antograph">Antograph</a></em>.</p>
<h4 style="font-family:Helvetica"> <a name="tool"></a>From Tool to Artwork</h4>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica">Having created numerous &quot;visual music&quot; programs during the 1990s as an offshoot of an education  in Computer Science at Brown University and Experimental Animation at RISD,  I sought to probe the boundary between a tool and a work of art. These experiments blurred the lines between drawing, animation, scientific visualization, art, and games. In 1989 I created <em>Motion Sketch</em> (1989) and later a networked version, <em>Motion Phone</em> (1995): programs  to author abstract animations similar to those created by Oskar Fischinger. After years of creating such programs, I set the following constraints to produce a series that more clearly stood as works of art:
<blockquote>
  <p style="font-family:Helvetica"><em>Full Screen</em>. Having studied cinema, I noticed that the computer's screen  has the  potential of cinema: as a rectangle of time-varying light it provides an infinite canvas. By taking over the full screen, one can create an entirely new immersive reality that replaces the false world of desktop tools. </p>
  <p style="font-family:Helvetica"><em>Human gesture</em>. Use human gestures as the sole input, since this is the body's entry into the computer; and only use geometrically essential properties for control such as direction, distance, and speed, avoiding  artificial constructs like the cartesian x- and y-axes.</p>
  <p style="font-family:Helvetica"><em>Immediately knowable, infinitely scalable</em>. In evaluating whether a sketch became an artwork, examine it to see if it can  be understood and used without instructions, and  more importantly, whether one can <em>get better</em> at the experience as one does with a musical instrument. The experience should reward more time invested and offer an infinite palette of expression, with surprises of discovery, and the possibility of mastery.</p>
  <p style="font-family:Helvetica"><em>No interface</em>. Remove all interface tools such as menus, icons, and pointers: these elements create the illusion of a workplace rather than an immersive experience.</p>
  <p style="font-family:Helvetica"><em>No color</em>. Stick to pure black and white and focus on <em>movement</em> as the early abstract animation pioneers Oskar Fischinger and Len Lye. This constraint was arbitrary, but one that focused the artistic process and gained inspiration from these pioneers' astonishing works.</p>
