    <p><span class="section"><em>MotionPhone </em> is an interactive app that lets you create abstract animations over a network with others: It's a unique combination of communication and creation. In <em>MotionPhone's</em> shared infinite canvas, people can create infinite variations of movement by recording the gestures from their fingertips. Its canvas is  an infinite world that one can zoom in and out of, making minute marks, or gigantic strokes.</span></p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p><em>Motion Phone</em>&nbsp;(1989-1996) evolved out of an exploration 
of how to make cinema with one's body. In film school at RISD, I had 
been inspired by two experimental animation pioneers. The first, <a title="Oskar Fischinger Archive" href="http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org/Fischinger/" target="_blank">Oskar Fischinger</a>,
 pioneered a cinema of pure abstraction. His earliest films are simple 
black and white forms, drawn frame-by-frame in charcoal. Yet the 
resulting movements, such as in&nbsp;<em>Study Number 7&nbsp;</em>(1931), have incredible emotional power. The second pioneer, <a title="Len Lye" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_Lye" target="_blank">Len Lye</a>,
 pioneered "direct cinema," created by marking directly on the film 
surface with pens, inks, or by scratching emulsion off of black leader, 
as in his masterpiece&nbsp;<em>Free Radicals</em>&nbsp;(1957).</p>
<p>I was searching for a way to make a hard-edged abstraction like 
Fischinger's by using my body directly as Lye did. In an epiphany one 
evening staring at the computer, I realized that the cursor was the most
 interesting object on the screen. Here was the only place that my body,
 through the mouse, came into the computer. Based on this understanding,
 I created Motion Sketch, originally written for a Sun Sparcstation, which attaches the movements of ones hand to 
the movements of abstract forms. These forms exist in a short one-second
 loop. The temporal complexity comes from the continuous layering of 
these forms, creating a rich motion painting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Motion Phone</em> (1995) was a networked version of Motion Sketch, written for Silicon Graphics' workstations. With 
this software, multiple computers, networked via the Internet, 
communicate together, working simultaneously in the same dynamic canvas.
 As an experiment in abstract visual communication, this enforces a few 
social rules. Instead of a fixed size canvas, Motion Phone provides an 
infinitely zoomable plane. Multiple ""conversations"" can take place at 
any position or scale within this virtual world. However, this results 
in a perceptual problem – each performer cannot be certain what the 
other is looking at. Similarly, performers have independent control of 
frame rate. If one person sets their frame rate low, they can seem to 
run circles around the other, creating at miraculous speed and with 
incredible temporal precision. Each performer can only erase his own 
work, and one can also choose to not display anyone else’s work if 
privacy is desired. However, the background color is set to the last 
person’s choice so that there is at least one thing to fight over: 
changes to background color are instantaneous and startling.</p>
<p>By working with a loop, the problem of communication latency becomes 
irrelevant. The one-second loop continues over-and-over for each viewer,
 and new material from other viewers appears whenever it arrives. As 
long as new material arrives within a few seconds of its creation, all 
the creators have the sense of the lively progress of a shared dynamic 
canvas.</p>
